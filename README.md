# r_capstone_project_movielens

This repository serves as a backup for files which are to be submitted as part of my MovieLens project in the Harvardx Data Science capstone course.

In the project.R file, three models are created to predict what a Netflix user might rate a movie they have never seen - providing an avenue for making more effective movie recommendations.  Ultimately, it's determined that a Matrix Factorization model made using the recosystem library is the most effective method as defined by generating the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

The R markdown report summarizes the project and exports to PDF when knitted.
